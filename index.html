                            <p>This is my calculator project from The Odin Project! I used JavaScript 
                                to make calculations with the filter function, and used arrays to keep track of inputted numbers. 
                                I used CSS to make the calculator look nice, choosing brown, orange, and tan colors.</p>

                            <p>This is another project I've done with The Odin Project, using mainly CSS. A sign up form with cozy coloring. 
                                The main theme is books.  Created using FlexBox and various positionings.</p>

                            <p>Another project from The Odin Project. When first created, it was simply pop-ups prompting answers from the user. 
                                However, once I learned of the DOM and improved with CSS, I was able to go back a create a more complex and visual 
                                game of virtual rock paper scissors</p>

                            <p>This project from The Odin Project was one I had great difficulty with at the beginning. Particularly in the 
                                creation of the individual boxes that change colors when hovered over. Finding examples from other people helped 
                                me finish this project.</p>

                            <p>This was one of the first webpages I created with The Odin Project. This project was a great introduction 
                                to HTML and some very basic CSS. It was exciting seeing how what I wrote in HTML and CSS was represented in 
                                a webpage.</p>

                                Grid and some Flexbox as well. This was a fun project, and a good opportunity to showcase some real-life projects 
                                that I've completed with The Odin Project.</p>
